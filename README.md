# Task-4-sql-query-

# SQL Project

This repository contains a SQL project demonstrating various SQL concepts and techniques, including data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joining, and advanced querying.

## Features

This project utilizes the following SQL features:

-   **SELECT Statements:** For retrieving data from tables.
-   **WHERE Clause:** For filtering data based on specified conditions.
-   **GROUP BY Clause:** For grouping rows that have the same values in specified columns into a summary row.
-   **ORDER BY Clause:** For sorting the result set of a query in ascending or descending order.
-   **JOIN Operations:**
    -   **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
    -   **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table.
    -   **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table.
-   **VIEWS:** Virtual tables based on the result-set of a SQL query.
-   **Subqueries:** Queries nested within another SQL query.

## Project Structure

-   `customer.sql`: This file contains all the SQL queries and statements used in the project, demonstrating the features listed above.
-   `sample output.pdf`: This PDF document contains the output and results generated by executing the SQL queries in `sql_code.sql`.

## Usage

1.  **Review the SQL Code:** Examine the `customer.sql` file to understand the various SQL queries and their application.
2.  **Analyze the Output:** Refer to the `sample output.pdf` file to see the results and how the different SQL operations affect the data.
